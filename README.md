\# CMF‑Framework  

\### Coherence Mirror Framework — Node in the ECM Lineage



\## Overview

The CMF‑Framework defines the core structures, operators, and conceptual mappings used to analyze coherence across multiple informational domains. It replaces earlier ECM variants and establishes the foundation for all downstream branches, including CMF‑Diamond and HECM.



This repository is an example of an \*\*Active Manuscript\*\*:  

a scholarly artifact that is both a conceptual model and an executable cognitive architecture.



\## Lineage

ECM‑Framework (root)  

→ CMF‑Framework (node)  

→ HECM (node)  

→ CMF‑Diamond (branch)  

→ HECM‑Diamond (branch)



\## Purpose

The CMF‑Framework provides the conceptual definitions, operators, diagrams, and lineage notes that support coherence analysis across empirical, conceptual, axiological, and socially mediated domains.



\## Four‑Mirror Architecture

CMF‑Framework establishes the triadic structure inherited from ECM and prepares the ground for the \*\*four‑mirror architecture\*\* introduced in CMF‑Diamond:

\- Empirical  

\- Conceptual  

\- Axiological  

\- Social (introduced downstream)
