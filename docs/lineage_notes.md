# Lineage Notes for the Coherence Mirror Framework (CMF)

This document records the developmental lineage of the Coherence Mirror Framework.  
It provides context for how the framework emerged, why its structure looks the way it does,  
and how its concepts evolved into a coherent system.

## 1. Origins
The CMF began as an attempt to formalize patterns of relational stability observed  
across multiple domains. Early drafts focused on identifying recurring structures  
and mapping their interactions.

## 2. Conceptual Consolidation
As the framework matured, key concepts such as coherence, mapping, field, and operator  
were refined into stable definitions. This phase established the vocabulary that  
underlies all CMF objects.

## 3. Structural Formalization
The introduction of nodes, fields, and mappings provided a consistent internal structure  
for representing complex systems. This allowed CMF objects to be expressed in both  
human‑readable and machine‑readable forms.

## 4. Operator Development
Operators were introduced to describe how CMF objects transform over time.  
Primitive operators emerged first, followed by composite operators that encode  
multi‑step transformations.

## 5. Schema Definition
To support reproducibility and interoperability, the CMF was formalized into JSON schemas.  
These schemas define the structure, metadata, and required fields for CMF objects  
and operators.

## 6. Example Objects
Minimal example objects were created to demonstrate how the schemas are used in practice.  
These examples serve as templates for future CMF instances.

## 7. Documentation Layer
The documentation layer was added to provide conceptual definitions, operator descriptions,  
a glossary, and public‑facing explanations. This layer ensures clarity for both technical  
and non‑technical audiences.

These lineage notes provide a historical and structural context for the CMF,  
supporting future development and collaboration.
