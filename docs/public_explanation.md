# Public Explanation of the Coherence Mapping Framework (CMF)

The Coherence Mapping Framework (CMF) is a structured method for representing relationships, transformations, and patterns within complex systems. It provides a clear way to describe how elements connect, how they influence one another, and how those relationships evolve over time.

## **What CMF Does**
CMF helps users:

- Represent systems in a consistent, structured format  
- Identify stable patterns of relationship (coherence)  
- Map how information or influence flows through a system  
- Apply transformations to update or reorganize structures  
- Analyze the internal logic or dependencies within a system  

---

## **Why CMF Exists**
Many systems—technical, conceptual, organizational, or narrative—contain hidden structures that shape how they behave. CMF provides a way to make those structures explicit, visible, and workable.

It is not tied to any specific domain.  
It can be used for:

- Modeling ideas  
- Analyzing workflows  
- Describing conceptual relationships  
- Structuring knowledge  
- Supporting research or creative work

## **How CMF Works**
A CMF representation includes:

- **Nodes** — the basic units of structure  
- **Fields** — the domains or contexts in which meaning operates  
- **Mappings** — the directed relationships between elements  
- **Operators** — transformations that modify or analyze the structure  
- **Metadata** — descriptive information for clarity and versioning  

These components are defined through JSON schemas to ensure consistency and interoperability.

## **Who CMF Is For**
CMF is designed for anyone working with complex ideas or systems, including:

- Researchers  
- Writers  
- Designers  
- Analysts  
- Developers  
- Educators  

It is intentionally general so it can adapt to many contexts.

---

## **What CMF Is Not**
CMF is not:

- A programming language  
- A predictive model  
- A philosophical doctrine  
- A fixed ontology  

It is a flexible framework for representing and transforming structured relationships.

---

## **Summary**
The Coherence Mapping Framework provides a clear, structured way to represent complex systems. By defining nodes, fields, mappings, and operators, CMF helps users understand and work with the underlying patterns that shape how systems behave.

It is simple enough for newcomers, yet powerful enough for advanced analysis and creative exploration.
