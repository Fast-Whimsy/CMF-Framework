# Conceptual Definitions for the Coherence Mapping Framework (CMF)

This document provides the foundational concepts used throughout the Coherence Mapping Framework. These definitions establish the shared vocabulary required to understand CMF objects, operators, mappings, and coherence structures.

---

## **1. Coherence**
A stable relationship between elements of a system such that changes in one element meaningfully relate to changes in another. Coherence is not uniformity; it is structured relational stability.

---

## **2. Mapping**
A directed relationship that connects one element, field, or structure to another. Mappings define how information, influence, or structure flows within a CMF object.

---

## **3. Field**
A domain of meaning, influence, or structure within a CMF object. Fields provide the context in which mappings operate.

---

## **4. Node**
A discrete unit within a CMF object that can hold structure, metadata, or relationships. Nodes are the basic building blocks of CMF representations.

---

## **5. Operator**
A transformation applied to a CMF object or its components. Operators define how structures evolve, combine, or resolve.

---

## **6. Coherence Object**
A structured representation that contains nodes, fields, mappings, and metadata. It is the primary unit of representation in CMF.

---

## **7. Coherence Pattern**
A recurring relational structure that appears across different CMF objects. Patterns allow generalization and reuse.

---

## **8. Metadata**
Human-readable descriptive information about a CMF object or operator, including name, version, and purpose.

---

## **9. Structure**
The internal organization of a CMF object, including its nodes, fields, and mappings. Structure is distinct from metadata.

---

## **10. Versioning**
The practice of tracking changes to CMF objects and operators over time to ensure reproducibility and clarity.
